# Arabic Corpus Project with Israel Innovation Institute
A website for the Arabic Corpus Project.
This is a joint project between the Data Science Institute at Reichman University and the Israel Innovation Institute.

# Tasks
## Task 1
Decide on versioning: Pages in the "_docs" folder can be versioned. Pages in the "pages" folder cannot.

I need to decide how to divide the "_docs" and "pages" folders and then how to use Versioning. One suggestion would be to migrate the "topics" folder from "pages" to "_docs", but this really depends on which pages we want to have versioning for.

See: https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/docs/versioning

Supposedly , we also need to decide if we want to have the "Release" option for every page, but I think removing it from some pages adds redundant overhead, especially since there's already a builtin tool in the template that says if a given page has no prior version in other releases.

## Task 2
Get clearance for website design and add content.
