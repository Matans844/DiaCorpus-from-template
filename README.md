# Tasks
## Task 1
Decide on versioning: Pages in the `_docs` folder can be versioned. Pages in the "pages" folder cannot.

I need to decide how to divide the `_docs` and "pages" folders and then how to use Versioning. One suggestion would be to migrate the `topics` folder from `pages" to `_docs`, but this really depends on which pages we want to have versioning for.

See: (https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/docs/versioning)[https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/docs/versioning]

Supposedly , we also need to decide if we want to have the `Release` option for every page, but I think removing it from some pages adds redundant overhead, especially since there's already a builtin working functionality in the template that notifies a user if the current page exists in the version the user chose.

## Task 2
Get clearance for website design and add content.

## Task 3
We need to add images, branding, favicons (a favicon is the small image used both for icons in a browser tab and when sending the website as a link in Whatsapp). In addition, we need to personalize the website. This includes adding email, github, social media (linkedin, link to our website at Reichman University), and other information in the `_config.yml` file.

## Task 4
Get a custom domain, and move the website there. Remove information related to the original template used here, (docsy)[https://github.com/vsoch/docsy-jekyll]
